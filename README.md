# radiator_performance-Excel
This Excel tool calculates the radiator return temperature as based on the performance/rating measures making use of LMTD.  


## Features
The main idea here is to develop simple and reliable emprical models for residential radiator units so to be used in system level modelling (i.e. at district heating simulations). Hence, this Matlab models estimate the radiator behaviour in terms of return temperature at different operational conditions (e.g. changing heat demand rate at different degrees of supply temperature).
